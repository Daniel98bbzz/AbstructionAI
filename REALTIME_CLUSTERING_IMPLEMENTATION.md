# Real-time Clustering Implementation

## 🎯 Overview

The Real-time Clustering feature allows AbstructionAI to **immediately learn new domains** when users ask questions that don't match any existing semantic clusters. Instead of waiting for batch clustering scripts, the system creates new clusters on-the-fly, enabling instant intellectual expansion.

## 🧠 Strategic Purpose

**Immediate Domain Learning**: Every new area of knowledge that users explore is captured and learned in real-time, allowing the system to build expertise across unlimited domains without manual intervention.

**Continuous Expansion**: The system grows smarter with every unique question, automatically organizing knowledge into semantic clusters for future optimization.

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### Core Components

#### 1. Similarity Threshold Detection
**Location**: `server/managers/Supervisor.js:194-219`

```javascript
const SIMILARITY_THRESHOLD = 0.75; // Cosine similarity threshold
```

- **Purpose**: Determines when a query is "different enough" to warrant a new cluster
- **Logic**: If cosine similarity < 0.75, create new cluster
- **Adjustable**: Can be tuned based on domain specificity needs

#### 2. Real-time Cluster Creation
**Location**: `server/managers/Supervisor.js:279-310`

```javascript
async createRealtimeCluster(embedding, query) {
  const newCluster = await supabase.from('semantic_clusters').insert({
    centroid: embedding,           // Query embedding as centroid
    size: 1,                      // Start with size 1
    representative_query: query,   // Query as representative
    clustering_version: 'realtime' // Mark as real-time created
  });
}
```

**Process Flow**:
1. **No Match Detection** → System detects no existing cluster with sufficient similarity
2. **Immediate Creation** → New cluster created in `semantic_clusters` table
3. **Proper Association** → Current interaction linked to new cluster
4. **Template Generation** → Foundational template created for cluster

#### 3. Enhanced Template Auto-Generation
**Location**: `server/index.js:1091-1134`

```javascript
if (isNewCluster) {
  // Always create foundational template for new clusters
  shouldCreateTemplate = true;
  templateSource = 'realtime_cluster';
  insertReason = 'new_cluster_foundation';
}
```

**Template Creation**:
- **Immediate**: Template created from the successful response
- **Comprehensive**: Includes metadata about response structure
- **Foundational**: Serves as starting point for future template evolution

### Database Schema Integration

#### Tables Modified:

1. **`semantic_clusters`**
   - `clustering_version: 'realtime'` - Identifies real-time created clusters
   - `centroid` - Set to the query embedding
   - `size: 1` - Initially contains one query

2. **`interactions`**
   - `cluster_id` - Linked to newly created cluster
   - `semantic_cluster_id` - Same as cluster_id for consistency

3. **`prompt_templates`**
   - `source: 'realtime_cluster'` - Identifies templates from new clusters
   - `metadata.created_from_cluster_creation: true` - Tracks origin

## 🚀 System Flow

### Step-by-Step Process:

1. **Query Received**
   ```
   POST /api/query
   Body: { query: "How do quantum computers use superposition?" }
   ```

2. **Embedding Generation**
   ```
   OpenAI text-embedding-ada-002 → 1536D vector
   ```

3. **Cluster Matching**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM match_semantic_cluster(embedding_vector);
   ```

4. **Similarity Check**
   ```javascript
   if (similarity < 0.75) {
     // Create new cluster
   }
   ```

5. **Real-time Cluster Creation**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO semantic_clusters (centroid, size, representative_query, clustering_version)
   VALUES (embedding, 1, query, 'realtime');
   ```

6. **Template Selection**
   ```
   No existing templates → Use global best template as starting point
   ```

7. **Response Generation**
   ```
   GPT-4 with global template enhancement
   ```

8. **Template Creation**
   ```sql
   INSERT INTO prompt_templates (template_text, source, cluster_id)
   VALUES (response, 'realtime_cluster', new_cluster_id);
   ```

9. **Future Queries**
   ```
   Similar queries → Match to new cluster → Use learned template
   ```

## 📊 Monitoring & Analytics

### Key Metrics:

1. **Real-time Clusters Created**
   ```sql
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM semantic_clusters 
   WHERE clustering_version = 'realtime';
   ```

2. **Templates per New Cluster**
   ```sql
   SELECT cluster_id, COUNT(*) as template_count
   FROM prompt_templates 
   WHERE source = 'realtime_cluster'
   GROUP BY cluster_id;
   ```

3. **Domain Expansion Rate**
   ```sql
   SELECT DATE(created_at) as date, COUNT(*) as new_domains
   FROM semantic_clusters 
   WHERE clustering_version = 'realtime'
   GROUP BY DATE(created_at);
   ```

### Logging Output:

```

## 🧪 Testing

### Test Script: `test_realtime_clustering.js`

**Purpose**: Validates real-time clustering with queries from novel domains

**Test Domains**:
- Quantum Physics
- Ancient History  
- Marine Biology
- Cryptocurrency

**Usage**:
```bash
# Start server first
npm run server

# Run test (in separate terminal)
node test_realtime_clustering.js
```

**Expected Results**:
- 4 new clusters created with `clustering_version: 'realtime'`
- 4 new templates with `source: 'realtime_cluster'`
- Each query properly associated with its new cluster

## ⚙️ Configuration

### Similarity Threshold Tuning:

**Current**: `0.75` (75% similarity required)

**Adjustment Guidelines**:
- **Higher (0.8-0.9)**: More clusters, finer granularity
- **Lower (0.6-0.7)**: Fewer clusters, broader domains
- **Optimal**: Balance between specificity and organization

### Performance Considerations:

1. **Database Impact**: Minimal - single INSERT operation
2. **Response Time**: ~50ms additional for cluster creation
3. **Storage**: Negligible - one row per new domain
4. **Scalability**: Linear growth with novel domains

## 🔮 Future Enhancements

### Planned Improvements:

1. **Adaptive Thresholds**: Dynamic similarity thresholds based on domain complexity
2. **Cluster Merging**: Automatic merging of overly similar real-time clusters
3. **Domain Classification**: AI-powered domain naming for new clusters
4. **Learning Acceleration**: Faster template optimization for new clusters

### Integration Opportunities:

1. **User Feedback Loop**: User confirmation for new domain creation
2. **Expert Validation**: Optional expert review of new clusters
3. **Batch Reconciliation**: Periodic alignment with batch clustering
4. **Cross-Domain Learning**: Template sharing between related clusters
