## 🔴 **WITHOUT Template Recommendations (Old Experience)**

### **User Journey:**
```
Alice visits → Dashboard → Click "New Query" → Types question → Gets generic response
```

### **Query Submission:**

🤖 Generic AI Response:

## How Algorithms Work

Algorithms are step-by-step procedures for solving problems. 

1. **Input**: Data goes in
2. **Processing**: Steps are executed  
3. **Output**: Result comes out

Example: Sorting numbers from smallest to largest.

Common types:
- Searching algorithms
- Sorting algorithms  
- Graph algorithms

Time complexity: O(n), O(log n), O(n²)

Would you like to know more about any specific type?
```

**Issues:**
- ❌ Generic explanation not tailored to Alice's learning style
- ❌ No awareness of Alice's cluster preferences  
- ❌ Missing analogies that work well for similar users
- ❌ No optimization based on successful patterns
- ❌ Low engagement and retention

## How Algorithms Work: A Practical Guide

Based on your learning pattern and what works well for users like you, 
here's a comprehensive explanation with practical examples:

### 🍳 **Think of Algorithms Like Cooking Recipes**
*(Users in your cluster love cooking analogies - 91% find them helpful)*

Just like a recipe, an algorithm is a precise set of instructions:

**Recipe Example: Making Pancakes**
1. **Input**: Flour, eggs, milk (your ingredients)
2. **Process**: Mix → Heat → Pour → Flip → Stack
3. **Output**: Delicious pancakes!

**Programming Example: Finding the Largest Number**
1. **Input**: [3, 7, 2, 9, 1] (list of numbers)
2. **Process**: Compare each number, remember the biggest
3. **Output**: 9 (the largest number)

### 🏗️ **Building Blocks Approach**
*(Step-by-step explanations work best for your learning style)*

**1. Sequence** - Do things in order
```
Step 1: Get ingredients
Step 2: Mix them  
Step 3: Cook
```

**2. Selection** - Make decisions
```
IF batter is smooth THEN start cooking
ELSE keep mixing
```

**3. Iteration** - Repeat actions
```
WHILE pancakes remain:
  Pour batter → Cook → Flip → Remove
```

### 💡 **Real-World Examples You'll Love**
*(Based on successful examples from your cluster)*

**GPS Navigation Algorithm:**
- Input: Your location + destination
- Process: Calculate shortest path through roads
- Output: Turn-by-turn directions

**Social Media Feed Algorithm:**
- Input: Your interests + friends' posts
- Process: Rank posts by relevance
- Output: Personalized timeline

### 🚀 **Why This Matters for You**
Since you're interested in computer science (like 89% of your cluster), 
understanding algorithms helps you:
- Write better code
- Solve problems systematically  
- Think logically about complex tasks

### 🎯 **Next Steps**
Based on users with similar interests:
- Try implementing a simple sorting algorithm
- Practice with algorithm visualization tools
- Join our algorithms study group
