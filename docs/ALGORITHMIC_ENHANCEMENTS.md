# Algorithmic Enhancements Implementation

This document describes the algorithmic enhancements implemented in the crowd wisdom system as part of Section D.

## 1. Confidence-Weighted Similarity Threshold ✅

### Implementation
- **Location**: `server/services/QueryClusteringService.js`
- **Methods**: `calculateEmbeddingVariance()`, `calculateDynamicThreshold()`

### How It Works
1. Calculate embedding variance across dimensions to determine confidence level
2. Adjust similarity threshold based on variance:
   - **Low variance** (< 0.01) → **High confidence** → Lower threshold (0.25) → Easier to match
   - **High variance** (> 0.05) → **Low confidence** → Higher threshold (0.35) → Harder to match
   - **Medium variance** → Base threshold (0.30)

### Database Tracking
- `crowd_wisdom_query_assignments.dynamic_threshold` - The threshold used for this query
- `crowd_wisdom_query_assignments.embedding_variance` - The calculated variance

### Test Results
✅ Dynamic threshold is calculated and logged during cluster assignment
✅ Different query types show different variance levels
✅ Threshold reasoning is logged for debugging

## 2. Eager Template Warm-Up ✅

### Implementation
- **Location**: `server/services/QueryClusteringService.js`
- **Method**: `generateEagerPromptEnhancement()`, `createNewCluster()`

### How It Works
1. When creating a new cluster, immediately generate a basic prompt enhancement
2. Uses generic success factors as a skeleton template
3. Stores initial enhancement with version 1

### Database Changes
- `crowd_wisdom_clusters.prompt_enhancement_version` - Tracks enhancement versions
- New clusters start with version 1 and a generic enhancement

### Benefits
- New clusters immediately have some guidance instead of starting empty
- Faster improvement cycle as learning builds on existing foundation

### Test Results
✅ New clusters are created with initial prompt enhancements
✅ Enhancement version tracking is working
✅ Generic templates are generated successfully

## 3. ε-Greedy Exploration ✅

### Implementation
- **Location**: `server/services/QueryClusteringService.js`
- **Method**: `shouldUseExploration()`, `findOrCreateCluster()`

### How It Works
1. For clusters with success rate < 0.5, add 10% chance to ignore enhancement
2. Sets `exploration_mode = true` and `ignore_enhancement = true` in assignment
3. Allows comparison between enhanced and non-enhanced responses

### Database Tracking
- `crowd_wisdom_query_assignments.exploration_mode` - Whether exploration was used
- `crowd_wisdom_query_assignments.ignore_enhancement` - Whether to ignore enhancement

### Benefits
- Prevents poor-performing clusters from getting stuck in local optima
- Provides data for A/B testing enhanced vs. non-enhanced responses

### Test Results
✅ Exploration logic is implemented and triggered based on success rate
✅ Database fields are populated correctly
✅ Exploration events are logged

## 4. Feedback Quality Gating ✅

### Implementation
- **Location**: `server/managers/CrowdWisdomManager.js`
- **Method**: `assessFeedbackQuality()`, `calculateTextEntropy()`

### How It Works
Before triggering learning from positive feedback, check:
1. **Length check**: Feedback >= 10 characters
2. **Sentiment check**: Feedback is positive
3. **Entropy check**: Text entropy >= 2.0 (prevents repetitive text)

### Entropy Calculation
Uses character frequency distribution to calculate Shannon entropy:
- High entropy = diverse vocabulary = quality feedback
- Low entropy = repetitive text = poor quality

### Test Examples
- ❌ "Great" → Rejected (too short)
- ✅ "This was very helpful because..." → Accepted (good quality)
- ❌ "aaaa bbbb cccc" → Rejected (low entropy)

### Test Results
✅ Quality gating is applied before learning
✅ Entropy calculation works correctly
✅ Different feedback types are properly classified

## 5. Offline Evaluation & Auto-Rollback ✅

### Implementation
- **Location**: `scripts/offline_evaluation.js`
- **Class**: `OfflineEvaluator`

### How It Works
1. **Nightly job** evaluates clusters with version > 1
2. **Replays** past queries against both current (v2) and previous (v1) enhancements
3. **Compares** responses using OpenAI's evaluation capabilities
4. **Auto-rollback** if quality drops below threshold (0.7)

### Evaluation Process
1. Get clusters needing evaluation (version > 1, enough queries)
2. Retrieve previous enhancement version from learning logs
3. Generate responses with both versions for sample queries
4. Compare using GPT-4 evaluation
5. Calculate average quality score
6. Rollback if current version is significantly worse

### Database Integration
- Uses existing `crowd_wisdom_learning_logs` to track versions
- Updates `prompt_enhancement_version` during rollback
- Logs rollback events for auditing

### Usage
```bash
# Run as nightly cron job
node scripts/offline_evaluation.js
```

## Database Schema Changes

```sql
-- New fields added to support algorithmic enhancements
ALTER TABLE crowd_wisdom_clusters
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS prompt_enhancement_version INTEGER DEFAULT 1;

ALTER TABLE crowd_wisdom_query_assignments
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS ignore_enhancement BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS exploration_mode BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS dynamic_threshold NUMERIC(4,3),
ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS embedding_variance NUMERIC(8,6);
```

## Testing

### Comprehensive Test Suite
- **File**: `test_algorithmic_enhancements.js`
- Tests all 5 enhancements with real data
- Verifies database integration
- Checks edge cases and error handling

### Simple Test
- **File**: `simple_enhancement_test.js`
- Quick verification of core functionality
- Useful for debugging individual features

### Run Tests
```bash
node test_algorithmic_enhancements.js
node simple_enhancement_test.js
```

## Performance Impact

### Positive Impacts
- **Better clustering** through confidence-weighted thresholds
- **Faster learning** via eager template warm-up
- **Escaped local optima** through exploration
- **Higher quality learning** via feedback gating
- **Quality assurance** via offline evaluation

### Computational Costs
- **Minimal** for variance calculation and threshold adjustment
- **One-time** cost for eager enhancement generation
- **Periodic** cost for offline evaluation (runs nightly)
- **Statistical** overhead for exploration (10% of low-performing clusters)

## Configuration

All enhancement parameters are configurable in the respective classes:

```javascript
// QueryClusteringService
this.lowVarianceThreshold = 0.25;
this.highVarianceThreshold = 0.35;
this.lowVarianceCutoff = 0.01;
this.highVarianceCutoff = 0.05;

// CrowdWisdomManager  
this.minFeedbackConfidence = 0.7;
this.promptUpdateThreshold = 1;

// OfflineEvaluator
this.qualityThreshold = 0.7;
this.evaluationBatchSize = 100;
```

## Monitoring

### Key Metrics to Track
1. **Dynamic threshold distribution** - Are thresholds being adjusted appropriately?
2. **Exploration rate** - Is 10% exploration rate being achieved?
3. **Feedback quality rates** - What percentage of feedback passes gating?
4. **Rollback frequency** - How often do enhancements get rolled back?
5. **Overall system performance** - Are enhancements improving results?

### Logging
All enhancements include comprehensive logging through the existing system:
- Variance calculations and threshold decisions
- Exploration mode triggers
- Feedback quality assessments
- Enhancement generation and rollback events

## Production Readiness

✅ **Comprehensive error handling**
✅ **Extensive logging and monitoring**
✅ **Backward compatibility maintained**
✅ **Test coverage for all features**
✅ **Documentation complete**
